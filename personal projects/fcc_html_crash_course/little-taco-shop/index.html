        <h2>About <abbr title="Little Taco Shop">LTS</abbr></h2>
        <p><abbr title="Little Taco Shop">LTS</abbr> was founded in 2022. Our shop a was built from a <strong>love of
                tacos</strong> &#127790;&#x1F32E;&#x1F32E;. We hope our little shop adds a unique and interesting place
            to our little town.</p>

        <h2>Taco Trivia</h2>
        <details>
            <summary>When didt acos first appear in the United States?</summary>
            <p>
                The Taco was first introduced to the United States in 1905. Mexican migrants were coming in to work on
                railroads and other jobs and started to bring their delicious food with them. Tacos were essentially a
                street food at this time since they were highly portable and cheap.
